    <br />Joseph Morrow is one of London's leading Open Source Heroes. He's a big fan of biscuits and is newly converted to actually liking his bike. Joseph spends his days working as a designer and developer at With Associates.
<br />
<br />Along with his fondness for biscuits, Joseph often enjoys a tea. He enhances that enjoyment by rating the cups of tea made for him, based on marks out of 10. Please see the tea chart on the right in order to find out where his studio colleagues are currently sitting in the tables.<br /><br />
Joseph was the winner of this year's <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2014/en/group?groupID=511303">With Associates March Madness competition</a>, with his high-scoring bracket 'WINFEST'.
